# About this project

This is the codebase of the backend of the todos application.

You will almost start from scratch here. To run the backend, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Install all the dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Configure your MongoDB database, and copy/paste the connection string into the `.env` file. In other words, you need to replace the `ATLAS_URI` value with your own connection string. When doing so, please make sure that you have replaced the `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<database>` parts with your own.
3. Add your code.
3. Start the backend by runnning `npm start`.
